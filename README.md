sea of thieves loot calculator (working model is singleloot-broken)
beta 1.2

would like to add:
- nautical themed gui, possibly hosted on web?
- add voyages for stacking output
- finding best voyage bang for buck based on time
- shrouded ghost calculator
- fine tune random selection for specific loot pools/voyages
- possibly cluster voyage rewards in lists and call them and have them grab values from corresponding dictionary
- finish quest list
- finish additional items
- add emi bonus for value calculations/and gold rush

*fixed:
 - gold rush multiplier for fof
 - add gold rush multiplier to other quests
 - single item value output - being worked on in singleloot-broken branch (because it, and now the program, is broken)

added:
 - !loot, !quests, !search, !value functions
 - loot shows you a list of loot
 - quests shows you a list of quests
 - search allows you to list all types of treasure by keyword
 - value allows you to add single items of treasure (DOES NOT GUILD STACK - BASE VALUE ONLY)
