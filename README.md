sea of thieves loot calculator (working model is singleloot-broken)
beta 1.2

would like to add:
- nautical themed gui, possibly hosted on web?
- add voyages for stacking output
- finding best voyage bang for buck based on time
- shrouded ghost calculator
- fine tune random selection for specific loot pools/voyages
- possibly cluster voyage rewards in lists and call them and have them grab values from corresponding dictionary

  *fixed:
  - gold rush multiplier for fof
  - add gold rush multiplier to other quests
  - finish quest list
  - finish additional items
  - single item value output - being worked on in singleloot-broken branch (because it, and now the program, is broken)
